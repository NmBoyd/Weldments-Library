# Weldments-Library
A small library for Solidworks Weldments

1. Download and extract the weldment library (listed at the bottom of the video) to your documents folder
2. Inside of it, you should have the frc folder. Create an "ansi inch" folder and move the FRC folder into it, so your heirarchy looks like this
3. Open up solidworks. At the top, go to tools->options.
4. Go to system options, file locations, and at the drop down, **make sure to have it set to weldment profiles**
5. Delete everything that is there (click and choose delete on the right)
6. Add the 1138 Weldment Library folder
7. **Hit Ok*
